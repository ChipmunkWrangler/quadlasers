* Right now, the game is super fun and starwarsy if you play it as intended, but it is more effective to stand in one place and hold the fire button down.
 * Limited ammo, regenerating over time or when you hit an asteroid
  * with shields, like Spacewar?
 * Lose points for shooting
 * Slower rate of fire, so autofire tends to miss moving targets
 * faster asteroid orbits
 * faster asteroid movement towards centre, so some asteroids never make a complete orbit
 * Instead of fire, do lock-on: you have to stay on target for a second or two, then it fires automatically
 * Add friendly ships that you don't want to hit
 * Add enemy ships that try to get behind you
 * Since my main goal is for the player to be forced to spin, rather than forbidding autofire, maybe enemy ships are the best idea
* Asteroids travel in both directions? 
* VR version!
* Show death screen (from above or turn to face)
* flashing when something gets close
