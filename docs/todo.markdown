These are short term and/or technical todos.
The next todos should come from [[DesignDoc]]

	The current "random great circle" version makes me seasick. I think it is the combination of spinning and moving the head up and down
	   Let Talea try it, maybe it's ok for kids
	   Try horizontal circles limited to 45 degrees above and below y =0
	   Try putting an obstacle behind the player to stop 360 degree rotations
	Maybe we need breaks: not tracking constantly, but tracking, listening, tracking...
	Some of the asteroids are too fast for me to catch by tracking them.
	
T is too nervous because she doesn't know where to look

// If you eliminate modes (because everyone likes others better), move them to the end of the mode list and set numModes so that you can't reach them (in other words, keep the code). Because the multiplayer version might make different modes preferable.
