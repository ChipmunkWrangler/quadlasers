These are short term and/or technical todos.
The next todos should come from [[DesignDoc]]

Sometimes it feels like I should hit and I don't (it's in my crosshairs)

Check each mode with few and many asteroids
	   Let Talea try it, maybe it's ok for kids
	Maybe we need breaks: not tracking constantly, but tracking, searching, tracking...
	Some of the asteroids are too fast for me to catch by tracking them.
	
// If you eliminate modes (because everyone likes others better), move them to the end of the mode list and set numModes so that you can't reach them (in other words, keep the code). Because the multiplayer version might make different modes preferable.

Mode 2 seems pretty good to me. Try 5. Use great circle asteroids occasionally. (like UFO in asteroids)
