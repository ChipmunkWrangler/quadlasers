These are short term and/or technical todos.
The next todos should come from [[DesignDoc]]

Check each mode with few and many asteroids
   Let Talea try it, maybe it's ok for kids
	Maybe we need breaks: not tracking constantly, but tracking, searching, tracking...
	Some of the asteroids are too fast for me to catch by tracking them.
	
// If you eliminate modes (because everyone likes others better), move them to the end of the mode list and set numModes so that you can't reach them (in other words, keep the code). Because the multiplayer version might make different modes preferable.

Focus on mode 7.

Try Waves 3 - 5, 1 / 3s, 30s between waves.
Try Waves 1 - 3, 1 / s, 10s between waves.
Try waves 5 - 10, 1/3s, start next wave when you have destroyed all for this wave, and increase difficulty.
Try twice as large asteroids
  But have them crash into you earlier -- we want to avoid the "no time to react, just got lucky".
Try each type of asteroid a different size, see what is most satisfying.
Try doubling rate of fire
Try restricting turning instead of backstop. OR backstop that lets you turn futher (a triangle rather than a plane, I guess).
