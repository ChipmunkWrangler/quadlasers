* Right now, the game is super fun and starwarsy if you play it as intended, but it is more effective to stand in one place and hold the fire button down.
 * limited ammo / power, regenerating slowly 
  * with shields, like Spacewar?
 * slower rate of fire
 * faster asteroid orbits
 * faster asteroid movement towards centre
* Asteroids travel in both directions? 
* VR version!
* Show death screen (from above or turn to face)
* Sound and flashing when something gets close
